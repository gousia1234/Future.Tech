        <h1 style="color:burlywood;text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(219, 58, 9);">3.5G</h1>
        <img id="img3"src="image/5g.jpg">
        <p>The deployment of 5G networks, a key technology trend, is expected to accelerate in the coming years, bringing faster speeds and lower latency to mobile devices. 5G, a significant technology trend, is the fifth generation of mobile network technology that is designed to provide faster speeds and more reliable connections than previous generations. It is a wireless technology that operates in the millimeter wave frequency band, which allows it to transmit data at high speeds over short distances.
            Some of the key features of 5G include:

1.High speed: 5G networks are now much faster than previous generations, with peak speeds of up to 20 Gbps (gigabits per second). This means that 5G networks can transmit data much faster than 4G networks, making it possible to download and stream high-definition video, play online games, and use other data-intensive applications without experiencing delays or interruptions.
2.Lower latency: Latency is the time it takes for a signal to travel between a device and a network. 5G networks have significantly lower latency than previous generations, with an average latency of around 1 millisecond. This means that 5G networks can respond to requests much faster, making them ideal for applications that require real-time interactions, such as remote surgery or self-driving cars.
3.More capacity: 5G networks can support many more devices than previous generations, thanks to their use of advanced technologies such as beamforming and massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple outputs). This makes 5G ideal for use in crowded areas, such as sports stadiums or city centers, where many devices are competing for network resources.
4.Increased reliability: 5G networks are designed to be more reliable than previous generations, with lower rates of dropped calls and lost connections. This makes them ideal for use in mission-critical applications, such as emergency services or industrial automation.
We can say that 5G is expected to revolutionize the way we use mobile devices and connect to the internet, enabling new applications and services that were not possible before.

        <h1 style="color:brown;text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px green;">6.Human Augmentation</h1>
        <img id="img6"src="image/human augmentation.avif">
        <p>Have you heard of human augmentation? It’s a significant technology trend where technology is used to enhance our bodies or minds. This can include things like prosthetics, exoskeletons, or even a connection between our brain and a computer!

            In the next few years, it’s likely that we’ll see even more advances in this field. For example, prosthetics and exoskeletons might become even better and more easily available, helping people with disabilities do things they couldn’t before. Brain-computer interfaces might let our brains work with computers directly, making us smarter and more skilled. And augmented reality or virtual reality could change the way we experience the world.
            
            We think that human augmentation has a lot of possibilities to make our lives better. But it’s important to think about the ethical side too and make sure it’s used in a good way.</p>
